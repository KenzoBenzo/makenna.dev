        1. Building frosted-ui for Whop
      </h3>

      <p className='leading-8'>
        I&apos;m really proud of the bespoke design system called{" "}
        <Code>`frosted-ui`</Code> that I built for Whop and later open-sourced.
        It began as a simple 6 component library, with the idea that the
        internal team needed better developer experience. When I joined it
        evolved into:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-['â€”_'] list-inside marker:text-mint-10 mt-2 space-y-3">
        <li>
          65+ components. The simplest being a straight forward link with only
          anchor tag props passed through - and the most complex was a WYSIWYG
          built around the headless tooling from TipTap.
        </li>
        <li>
          Used across 5 different applications by 10+ developers before then
          being open sourced.{" "}
          <StyledExternalLink href='https://github.com/whopio/frosted-ui-legacy/tree/v0.0.1-canary.22'>
            Here is where you can find the old version
          </StyledExternalLink>{" "}
          of the repo where I wrote the majority of the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          A well maintained and thoroughly used <strong>documentation</strong>{" "}
          site using Storybook. I specifically focused on documenting first the
          props, then use cases I thought were common, and lastly the edge
          cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pixel perfect attention to detail such as incorporating opacity values
          into regularly used color tokens for better contrast on the different
          hierarchies of backgrounds.
        </li>
        <li>4 distinct themes and a custom hook for switching themes.</li>
        <li>
          Micro animations were some of my favorite. I really appreciate when
          motion makes an interface feel more alive, but doesn&apos; take away
          from the content.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Heron was a project where I got to sweat the design details and had the
        time to do so. This was a data-heavy application so I spent much of my
        focus regarding the UI/UX on interactive charts and tables.
      </p>
      <p className='leading-8'>
        Above, you&apos;re looking at one of the ways that I dug into displaying
        complex data in this case what could be hundreds of employees. This is
        built on-top of the filters API from <Code>`react-table`</Code>. Unseen
        from this video, I also built out customization for column visibility
        and the ability to save custom filter combinations as views.
