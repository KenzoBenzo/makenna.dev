## Cohere UI elements have a ton of potential

I really love the direction that Cohere has taken with their UI elements following their brand

<ExampleFrame>
	<CohereArrowButton>Hello world</CohereArrowButton>
</ExampleFrame>

<div className='h-8' />

<ExampleFrame>
	<CohereButton>Hello world</CohereButton>
</ExampleFrame>
